## 📊 The EDA Mission Briefing  

This repository contains the submission for **The Manhattan Project’s Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Individual Challenge**.  
The mission was to dive deep into the Spotify dataset and extract actionable insights for **Spotify Tracks**, with a sharp focus on:  

- Listener Behavior 👥🎧
- Track Performance 🎵🗓️
- Streaming Patterns 🎙️📈

I combined data cleaning, statistical exploration, and insightful visualization to uncover hidden trends and help Spotify make smarter, data-driven decisions about music trends, audience preferences, and content strategy.

# 🔍 Key Insights & Findings

Our analysis of the music catalog dataset uncovered the following highlights:

- **Listener-Friendly Mid-Ranges Dominate:** Most tracks feature moderate energy and danceability, avoiding extreme highs or lows → this strategy ensures broad mass appeal and prevents listener fatigue.

- **Shift Toward Moodier Tones:** Musical "positivity" (valence) has steadily declined over the decades, even as tracks remain energetic → this reflects a growing market for more emotionally complex or somber music.

- **Growing Multilingual Diversity:** While English and Tamil historically dominate, languages like Hindi and Korean show significant growth → highlights the need for a globalized catalog and improved language metadata to serve a diverse audience.

- **Power Law in Popularity:** A small number of tracks, artists, and nostalgic eras (the 70s & 2000s) drive the majority of listens → balance blockbuster promotion with discovery features for niche content to maximize engagement and retention.
